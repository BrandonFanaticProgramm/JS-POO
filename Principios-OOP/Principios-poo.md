# OBJECT PROGRAMM PRINCIPIES

- <p style="color: red">Object Oriented Languagues promote:</p> modularity and code reusability

<br>

- There is not a specification or technical document for OOP

- It's based from common sense from papers of early researchers

<h2>Two Accepted definitions</h2>

for define a programming as OO

- Capability to model problems through objects

- Support few principles to grant modularity and code reuse

<h2>Model through OB</h2>

Describe reality using objects and its relationships

- Association
    - Object capability to refer another object

- Aggregation
    - 

    - Object capability to refer one or more independent objects

- Composition

    - Object capability to refer one or more dependent objects


<h2>OOP Principles</h2>

grant modularity and code reuse

- Encapsulation

    - Capability to concentrate into a single entity data and code that manipulates it. hidden internal details


- Inheritance

    - mechanism by which object acquires some or all features of one or more objects

- Polymorphism
